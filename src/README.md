### What I learned
Conditional Rendering: I discovered how to conditionally render elements in React using JSX. By using expressions and conditional operators, I was able to control the visibility and behavior of elements based on certain conditions.

Template Literals: I learned about template literals in JavaScript and how they can be used to dynamically construct strings with embedded expressions. I used template literals to create dynamic class names in React components.
